## Python Regular Expression Tutorial

[Regex Table](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial#table)

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. 

```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")


Match!
```
Do you notice the r at the start of the pattern Cookie?

This is called a **raw string literal**. It changes how the string literal is interpreted. Such literals are stored as they appear.
