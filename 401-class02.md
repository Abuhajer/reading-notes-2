[Python Modules and Packages](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)

**Python modules** and **Python packages** are two mechanisms that facilitate modular programming.

**Modular programming** is the process of breaking a large programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

**Advantages** to modularizing code in a large application:

- **Simplicity:** If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.

- **Maintainability:** If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.

- **Reusability:** Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused by other parts of the application. 

- **Scoping:** Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.

**Functions, modules and packages** are all constructs in Python that promote code modularization.

There are 3 different ways to define a module in Python:

- A module can be written in Python itself.
- A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
- A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.

A module’s contents are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.

To build a module in Python, all you need to do is create a file that contains legitimate Python code and then give the file a name with a .py extension. That’s it! 

## The import Statement

Module contents are made available to the caller with the import statement. The import statement takes many different forms:
```
import <module_name>

mport <module_name>[, <module_name> ...]

from <module_name> import <name(s)>

from <module_name> import *
 Python 3 does not allow the indiscriminate import * syntax from within a function

from <module_name> import <name> as <alt_name>[, <name> as <alt_name> …]

import <module_name> as <alt_name>
```

## Python Packages

Suppose you have developed a very large application that includes many modules. As the number of modules grows, it becomes difficult to keep track of them all if they are dumped into one location. This is particularly so if they have similar names or functionality. You might wish for a means of grouping and organizing them.

Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. In the same way that modules help avoid collisions between global variable names, packages help avoid collisions between module names.

Creating a package is quite straightforward, since it makes use of the operating system’s inherent hierarchical file structure. Consider the following arrangement:

```
mod1.py

def foo():
    print('[mod1] foo()')

class Foo:
    pass
```
```
mod2.py

def bar():
    print('[mod2] bar()')

class Bar:
    pass
```
Given this structure, if the pkg directory resides in a location where it can be found (in one of the directories contained in sys.path), you can refer to the two modules with dot notation (pkg.mod1, pkg.mod2) and import them with the syntax you are already familiar with:

```
>>> import pkg.mod1, pkg.mod2
>>> pkg.mod1.foo()
[mod1] foo()
>>> x = pkg.mod2.Bar()
>>> x
<pkg.mod2.Bar object at 0x033F7290>
```
## Package Initialization
If a file named __init__.py is present in a package directory, it is invoked when the package or a module in the package is imported. This can be used for execution of package initialization code, such as initialization of package-level data.

__init__.py

[Pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

```
# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

```
$ pytest

Due to pytest’s detailed assertion introspection, only plain assert statements are used.


[PyTest Tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/pytest-tutorial.html)

**What is PyTest?**

Pytest is a testing framework which allows us to write test codes using python. You can write code to test anything like database, API, even UI if you want. But pytest is mainly being used in industry to write tests for APIs.

**Why use PyTest?**

Some of the advantages of pytest are:
- Very easy to start with because of its simple and easy syntax.
- Can run tests in parallel.
- Can run a specific test or a subset of tests
- Automatically detect tests
- Skip tests
- Open source

[Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

**What is Recursion?**

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

**What is base condition in recursion?**

In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

```
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```
In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.
