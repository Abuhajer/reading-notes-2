**Responsive Overview**

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. 

**Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile**

 Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. 

Mobile generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. 

**Flexible Layouts**

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:
- flexible layouts
- media queries
- flexible media 

 
## All About Floats

[All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/)

Float is a CSS positioning property. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called "text wrap". Here is an example of that.

In web design, page elements with the CSS float property applied to them are just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around them. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page. This is distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning. Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them, whether they touch each other or not.

Float values:
1. Left
2. Right
3. Nene (default)
4. Inherit
