[How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. 

### Randint

If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

```
import random
import itertools

outcomes = { 'heads':0,
             'tails':0,
             }
sides = outcomes.keys()

for i in range(10000):
    outcomes[ random.choice(sides) ] += 1

print 'Heads:', outcomes['heads']
print 'Tails:', outcomes['tails']
```

[What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

### Why use Risk Analysis?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

### How to perform Risk Analysis?

There are three steps:

1. Searching the risk

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3. Measures for the risk identified
