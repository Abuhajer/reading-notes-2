## HTML Chapter 5 *(Images)*

Images should:
  - Be relevant
  - Convey information
  - Convey the right mood
  - Be instantly recognisable
  - Fit the color palet

It is best practice to store the images in a folder in your directory. Images are added using the \<img> element, with 2 attributes: src and alt. To specify an image size, we use the height and width attributes. 

HTML5 introduced new elements \<figure> and \<figcaption> to contain images and their caption.
