What you see in a website done using HTML and CSS. HTML describes the structure of a website with heading, paragraphs, images, etc. 
HTML uses tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <p>. We use the <html></html> tags to tell the browser that we are passing html content. Between the <head></head> tags we put information about the page. Everything inside the <body></body> tags is what is displayed in the page.

We use DOCTYPES to tell the browsers which version of HTML you are passing. We can also write comments using this: <!-- comment -->. We can use <div> and <span> to group elements together.
