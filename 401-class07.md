[Python scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)

The portion to make sure you cover is on global and nonlocal keywords. 

The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule.

The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.

## Understanding Scope

In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

**Global scope:** The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

**Local scope:** The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

## Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope

Python resolves names using the so-called LEGB rule, which is named after the Python scope for names. The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here’s a quick overview of what these terms mean:

- Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

- Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.

- Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.

## The global Statement
You already know that when you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, you create a new local name in the function scope. To modify this behavior, you can use a global statement. With this statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names.

The statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. You can also use multiple global statements with a name (or a list of names). All the names that you list in a global statement will be mapped to the global or module scope in which you define them.

```
>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     counter = counter + 1  # Fail trying to update counter
...
>>> update_counter()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in update_counter
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'counter' referenced before assignment
```

When you try to assign counter inside update_counter(), Python assumes that counter is local to update_counter() and raises an UnboundLocalError because you’re trying to access a name that isn’t defined yet.

If you want this code to work the way you expect here, then you can use a global statement as follows:

```
>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
...
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
1
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
2
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
```

## The nonlocal Statement

Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. If you want to modify them, then you need to use a nonlocal statement. With a nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.

The nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope. The following example shows how you can use nonlocal to modify a variable defined in the enclosing or nonlocal scope:

```
>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```

With the statement nonlocal var, you tell Python that you’ll be modifying var inside nested(). Then, you increment var using an augmented assignment operation. This change is reflected in the nonlocal name var, which now has a value of 200.

Unlike global, you can’t use nonlocal outside of a nested or enclosed function. To be more precise, you can’t use a nonlocal statement in either the global scope or in a local scope. Here’s an example:

```
>>> nonlocal my_var  # Try to use nonlocal in the global scope
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: nonlocal declaration not allowed at module level
>>> def func():
...     nonlocal var  # Try to use nonlocal in a local scope
...     print(var)
...
  File "<stdin>", line 2
SyntaxError: no binding for nonlocal 'var' found
```

Here, you first try to use a nonlocal statement in the global Python scope. Since nonlocal only works inside an inner or nested function, you get a SyntaxError telling you that you can’t use nonlocal in a module scope. Notice that nonlocal doesn’t work inside a local scope either.
