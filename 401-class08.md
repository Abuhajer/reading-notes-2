## List Comprehensions in Python

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. 
The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.


The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.


```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```

You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension. Notice the append method has vanished!

```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```

**new_list**
The new list (result).

**expression(i)**
Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.

**for i in old_list**
The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the old list.

**if filter(i)**
Apply a filter with an If-statement.

Examples: 
```
list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
 
print multiplied 
[9,12,15]

```

```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
The output should be: [‘t’, ‘i’, ‘a’, ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’]
```

## Using list comprehension in functions

Now, let’s see how we can use list comprehension in functions.

```
# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
  return x*2


# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:
>>> print double(10)
20
```

We can easily use list comprehension on that function.

```
>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
```
