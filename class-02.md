The HTML tags we use when creating a website allow the browsers to display the appropriate structure of the page. Tags are known as markup.  Structural markup used to describe headings and paragraphs and semantic markup, used to provide additional information such as quotations, emphasis, abbreviations, etc.  These elements should not be used to affect the structure of the webpage.

HTML Chapter 10 (Introducing CSS)

CSS is used to styled HTML. Just like HTML, there are several versions of CSS. The most current version is CSS3. It is better to put the CSS rules in a different file, although it is possible to put in the same file where the HTML is. One of the advantages of creating a separate file is that you can use the same file for different pages, keeping consistency between all of them. Also, it is easier when it comes to making changes. If you do not use a CSS rules in a separate file, you would need to update every single page to update 1 CSS rule. 

When using external CSS, you need to use the <link> element in the HTML page to tell the browser where to look for the CSS rules. To use internal CSS, youâ€™ll need to write the rules between the <style> element. 

Some rules are considered more specific than other rules in CSS. Generally, an id is more specific than a class, and a class is more specific than an element rule. If 2 rules are the same, the latter will take place. Important can be added to any property value to make sure it is more specific than any other rule that applies to the same element.
