## **Machine Learning**

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

### **Terminology**

- Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
- Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
- Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
- Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
- Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
- Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
- Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.
