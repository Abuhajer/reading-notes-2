Pandas stands for “Python Data Analysis Library”.

Pandas is quite a game changer when it comes to analyzing data with Python and it is one of the most preferred and widely used tools in data munging/wrangling if not THE most used one. Pandas is an open source, free to use (under a BSD license) and it was originally written by Wes McKinney.

What’s cool about Pandas is that it takes data (like a CSV or TSV file, or a SQL database) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called **data frame** that looks very similar to table in a statistical software (think Excel or SPSS for example. People who are familiar with R would see similarities to R too). This is so much easier to work with in comparison to working with lists and/or dictionaries through for loops or list comprehension.
