[Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)


## Object Initialization: __init__
Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```
The constructor takes care of setting up the object. In this case it receives the owner name, an optional start amount and defines an internal transactions list to keep track of deposits and withdrawals.

This allows us to create new accounts like this:

```
>>> acc = Account('bob')  # default amount = 0
>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)
```

## Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
It’s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class (a bit like API documentation.) There are two ways to do this using dunder methods:

__repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

__str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

Let’s implement these two methods on the Account class:

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
```

If you don’t want to hardcode "Account" as the name for the class you can also use self.__class__.__name__ to access it programmatically.

If you wanted to implement just one of these to-string methods on a Python class, make sure it’s __repr__.

Now I can query the object in various ways and always get a nice string representation:

```
>>> str(acc)
'Account of bob with starting amount: 10'

>>> print(acc)
"Account of bob with starting amount: 10"

>>> repr(acc)
"Account('bob', 10)"
```
