# [Data Science in a Nutshell](https://headstrait.com/data-science-in-a-nutshell/)

## Date Science
Data Science is a combination of scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured.

**Unstructured Data:** It does not have a predefined data model. It can be available in audio, video and text format.

**Structured Data:** It is mostly available in a text format which originates from databases or specific file formats like CSV (Comma Separated Values)

**Data Analytics** After categorizing data (unstructured or structured), you need to analyze it. Identifying patterns of the data and understanding the data by processing it in such a way that you convert the data into information.

 **Data Visualization** present the data visually so that decisions can be made.

 - When a human decision is involved, data analisys is sufficient.

 - When machine learns by identifying patterns in data, it's called Machine Learning.

 - When machine makes decisions on its own, those involving judgements, it's called Artificial Intelligence.


# [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

## JupiterLab
JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

# [Numpy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

[Numpy Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/index.htm)

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

Standard Python distribution doesn't come bundled with NumPy module. A lightweight alternative is to install NumPy using popular Python package installer, pip.

```
pip install numpy
```
The best way to enable NumPy is to use an installable binary package specific to your operating system. These binaries contain full SciPy stack (inclusive of NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, IPython, SymPy and nose packages along with core Python).

Linux
Package managers of respective Linux distributions are used to install one or more packages in SciPy stack.

For Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install python-numpy 
python-scipy python-matplotlibipythonipythonnotebook python-pandas 
python-sympy python-nose
```
