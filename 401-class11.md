## Date Science
Data Science is a combination of scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured.

**Unstructured Data:** It does not have a predefined data model. It can be available in audio, video and text format.

**Structured Data:** It is mostly available in a text format which originates from databases or specific file formats like CSV (Comma Separated Values)

**Data Analytics** After categorizing data (unstructured or structured), you need to analyze it. Identifying patterns of the data and understanding the data by processing it in such a way that you convert the data into information.

 **Data Visualization** present the data visually so that decisions can be made.

 - When a human decision is involved, data analisys is sufficient.

 - When machine learns by identifying patterns in data, it's called Machine Learning.

 - When machine makes decisions on its own, those involving judgements, it's called Artificial Intelligence.
