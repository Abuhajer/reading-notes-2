[Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

**What Is a File?**

A file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:

- Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

**File Paths**

The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

- Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
- File Name: the actual name of the file
- Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

To open a file in Python:
```
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
```
When you’re manipulating a file, there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encountering an error. The first way to close a file is to use the try-finally block:

```
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()
```

The second way to close a file is to use the with statement:

```
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```


[Exceptions in Python](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)

A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception.

**syntax error**
```
>>> print( 0 / 0 ))
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**exception error**
```
>>> print( 0 / 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```

**try / except**
```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
    print('The linux_interaction() function was not executed')
```
Warning: Catching Exception hides all errors…even those which are completely unexpected. This is why you should avoid bare except clauses in your Python programs. Instead, you’ll want to refer to specific exception classes you want to catch and handle. 

- A try clause is executed up until the point where the first exception is encountered.
- Inside the except clause, or the exception handler, you determine how the program responds to the exception.
- You can anticipate multiple exceptions and differentiate how the program should respond to them.
- Avoid using bare except clauses.

**The else Clause**

In Python, using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions.

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    print('Executing the else clause.')
```

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    try:
        with open('file.log') as file:
            read_data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(fnf_error)
```

**Cleaning Up After Using finally**
Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code. Python enables you to do so using the finally clause.

```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    try:
        with open('file.log') as file:
            read_data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(fnf_error)
finally:
    print('Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.')
```

After seeing the difference between syntax errors and exceptions, you learned about various ways to raise, catch, and handle exceptions in Python. In this article, you saw the following options:

- raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isn’t.
- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
- except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
