## Simple plot

In this section, we want to draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot. Starting from the default settings, we'll enrich the figure step by step to make it nicer.

The first step is to get the data for the sine and cosine functions:

```
import numpy as np

X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)
```
X is now a NumPy array with 256 values 
ranging from -π to +π (included). 

C is the cosine (256 values) and S is the sine (256 values).

To run the example, you can download each of the examples and run it using:
```
$ python exercice_1.py
```

## What is Bokeh
Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It is good for:

- Interactive visualization in modern browsers
- Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps
- Expressive and versatile graphics
- Large, dynamic or streaming data
- Easy usage from python (or Scala, or R, or...)
