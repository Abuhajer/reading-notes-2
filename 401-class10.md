## Stacks Terminology:

**Push -** Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

**Pop -** Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

**Top -** This is the top of the stack.

**Peek -** When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

**IsEmpty -** returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Stacks follow these concepts:

- **FILO -** First In Last Out 

- **LIFO -** Last In First Out

## Queues Terminology:

**Enqueue -** Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

**Dequeue -** Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

**Front -** This is the front/first Node of the queue.

**Rear -** This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

**Peek -** When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

**IsEmpty -** returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

## Queues follow these concepts:

- **FIFO -** First In First Out

- **LILO -** Last In Last Out
