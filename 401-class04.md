## Classes and Objects

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)
```
You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. For instance, if we were to define another object with the "MyClass" class and then change the string in the variable above:
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable) # blah
print(myobjecty.variable) # yackity
```
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function() # This is a message inside the class.
```

[Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

We use recursion when we want to break a large problem into smaller sub-problems. 

## Recursive Functions

A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

```
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!
```

```
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```
## Maintaining State
When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
- Keep the state in global scope

A demonstration should make things clearer. Let’s calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 using recursion. The state that we have to maintain is (current number we are adding, accumulated sum till now).

Here’s how you do that by threading it through each recursive call (i.e. passing the updated current state to each recursive call as arguments):

```
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)
```
